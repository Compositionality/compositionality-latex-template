# Article class

The Compositionality article class is a community effort maintained by the Executive Board and the Editors of Compositionality.

This repository provides the `compositionalityarticle` class and a template for typesetting articles in Compositionality - the open journal for the mathematics of composition.
The class is derived from `article.cls' available from [CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/article). The class may be distributed and/or modified under the conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3c of this license or (at your option) any later version.

## Bugs and issues
Please help us by opening a bug report in our bug-tracker under https://github.com/compositionality/latex-template/issues. 
Please reproduce any problem by providing the full source of a minimal working LaTeX file, as well as the log file showing the error. 

## Future changes
List of changes to the compositionalityarticle class that we would like to implement:

 - Title of the article in all caps and same font as is used on the website of the journal.

## Thanks
This class is heavily based on the `quantumarticle' class for the journal https://quantum-journal.org. We thank the editors of Quantum for sharing their experiences and expertise.
